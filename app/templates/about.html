        <h1> About Us </h1>
        <p> The IEHF is charitable organisation based in the UK, established 50 years ago to promote ergonomics.
            Its mission is to provide support for ergonomists and to spread knowledge about ergonomics to the wider community. </p>
        <p> The IEHF has provided this site to encourage learning about ergonomics among secondary school students and their
            teachers. It's important that we are effective in our aims and that we are providing information in the form and
            depth that you need. Please let us know how we can improve our service to you. </p>
