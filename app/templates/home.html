        <h2> Ever tried to eat soup with a fork? </h2>
        <p> It's not easy, is it? Well, ergonomics is about changing all that! We don't mean making it easy to eat soup with a fork, we mean giving you the right tools for the job. Ergonomics is about making your life simpler and safer by taking account of human characteristics when we design things. </p>
        <p> This site aims to answer all those questions about ergonomics that you haven't even thought of yet. </p>
