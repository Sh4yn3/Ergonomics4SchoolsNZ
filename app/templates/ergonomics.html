                <p><b> Ergo 路 nom 路 ics. </b></p>
                <p> Someone who is qualified in ergonomics is called an ergon路o路mist. </p>
                <p> Ergonomics is about 'fit': the fit between people, the things they do, the objects they use
                    and the environments they work, travel and play in. If good fit is achieved, the stresses on
                    people are reduced. They are more comfortable, they can do things more quickly and easily,
                    and they make fewer mistakes. So when we talk about 'fit', we don't just mean physical fit,
                    we are concerned with psychological and other aspects too. That is why ergonomics is often
                    called 'Human Factors'.

                <hr>
                <p><b> Ergonomics and human factors - are they the same thing? </b></p>

                <p> You could argue that they are, with the essential difference being that ergonomics has always
                    been the more common term within the UK, and Human Factors is favoured by the North Americans.
                    The two terms then would be interchangeable.  However, others would disagree and suggest that
                    human factors is a more general term. A few years ago the terms were combined in the name of
                    the American Society - now known as the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.  Incidentally,
                    the Oxford English Dictionary supports the equivalence of the terms.

                <h3> The Role of an Ergonomist </h3>

                <p> Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding
                    of the interactions among humans and other elements of a system. The profession applies
                    theoretical principles, data and methods to design in order to optimise human well-being and
                    overall system performance.
                </p>
                <p> Practitioners of ergonomics, ergonomists, contribute to the planning, design and evaluation of
                    tasks, jobs, products, organisations, environments and systems in order to make them compatible
                    with the needs, abilities, and limitations of people.
                </p>
                <p> Derived from the Greek ergon (work) and nomos (laws) to denote the science of work, ergonomics
                    is a systems-oriented discipline which now applies to all aspects of human activity. Practicing
                    ergonomists must have a broad understanding of the full scope of the discipline, taking into
                    account the physical, cognitive, social, organisational, environmental and other relevant factors.
                    Ergonomists often work in particular economic sectors or application domains. These application
                    domains are not mutually exclusive and they evolve constantly. New ones are created; old ones
                    take on new perspectives.
