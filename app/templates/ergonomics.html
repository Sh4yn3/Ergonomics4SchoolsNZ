          <p> Ergonomics is about 'fit': the fit between people, the things they do, the objects they use
              and the environments they work, travel and play in. If good fit is achieved, the stresses on
              people are reduced. They are more comfortable, they can do things more quickly and easily,
              and they make fewer mistakes. So when we talk about 'fit', we don't just mean physical fit,
              we are concerned with psychological and other aspects too. That is why ergonomics is often
              called 'Human Factors'.
          </p>
          <p> Someone who is qualified in ergonomics is called an ergon路o路mist. </p>

          <p><b> Ergonomics and human factors - are they the same thing? </b></p>

          <p> You could argue that they are, with the essential difference being that ergonomics has always
              been the more common term within the UK, and Human Factors is favoured by the North Americans.
              The two terms then would be interchangeable.  However, others would disagree and suggest that
              human factors is a more general term. A few years ago the terms were combined in the name of
              the American Society - now known as the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.  Incidentally,
              the Oxford English Dictionary supports the equivalence of the terms.

            <h3> The Role of an Ergonomist </h3>
          </div>

          <p> Ergonomics (or human factors) is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding
              of the interactions among humans and other elements of a system. The profession applies
              theoretical principles, data and methods to design in order to optimise human well-being and
              overall system performance.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> Practitioners of ergonomics, ergonomists, contribute to the planning, design and evaluation of
              tasks, jobs, products, organisations, environments and systems in order to make them compatible
              with the needs, abilities, and limitations of people.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> Derived from the Greek ergon (work) and nomos (laws) to denote the science of work, ergonomics
              is a systems-oriented discipline which now applies to all aspects of human activity. Practicing
              ergonomists must have a broad understanding of the full scope of the discipline, taking into
              account the physical, cognitive, social, organisational, environmental and other relevant factors.
              Ergonomists often work in particular economic sectors or application domains. These application
              domains are not mutually exclusive and they evolve constantly. New ones are created; old ones
              take on new perspectives.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Within the discipline, domains of specialisation represent deeper competencies in specific human
            attributes or characteristics of human interaction:
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> | Physical Ergonomics </h4>
          <p> 
            Physical Ergonomics is concerned with human anatomical, anthropometric, physiological and
            biomechanical characteristics as they relate to physical activity. The relevant topics include working
            postures, materials handling, repetitive movements, work-related musculoskeletal disorders, workplace
            layout, safety and health. It is also concerned with how the physical environment around you might affect
            your performance. 'Physical' here means the kinds of things physicists know and love - heat, light, noise,
            dust, chemicals, and so on.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> 
            For example, there's a thermal comfort range which suits people best - unless they are doing hard physical
            work, in which case they might prefer a cooler range.  Similarly with noise; at night, you might want things
            quiet so that you can sleep; in a club, you might want it a bit louder! Physical ergonomics is about
            understanding the effects of these aspects of the environment on people, and in particular, the harmful effects.
            Then you can design environments for people which won't harm them, and they might even enjoy the experience.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> | Cognitive Ergonomics </h4>
          <p>
            This is concerned with mental processes ('brain work'), such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor
            response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system. The relevant topics
            include mental workload, decision-making, skilled performance, human-computer interaction, human
            reliability, work stress and training as these may relate to human-system design.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Take Air Traffic Control as an example; the Controller has a screen (or two) built into the workstation,
            plus telephones and radios. This all presents the controller with information, which has to be understood,
            digested, predictions of problems worked out, decisions made, and then the decisions have to be communicated
            and executed.  Cognitive ergonomists would be looking at this process, and then trying to design the workstation,
            the whole system, the training, and the environment around the workstation to allow the process to happen
            swiftly and safely.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            For example, the ergonomist might do a lighting survey, to make sure the ceiling lights do not reflect off
            the screens, so that the controller can actually see what is on the screen (it's difficult to make the right
            decision when you can't read the information).  Cognitive ergonomists might also be interested in how long
            it is reasonable to expect controllers to work, so that they are off shift before the probability of them
            making a mistake begins to rise.  They might also try to introduce more automation, to give the controller
            more time to think about the problem aircraft, without having to check on the 'safe' aircraft at the same time.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> | Organisational Ergonomics </h4>
          <p>
            The optimisation of sociotechnical systems, including their organisational structures, policies, and processes.
            The relevant topics include communication, crew resource management, work design, design of working times,
            teamwork, participatory design, community ergonomics, cooperative work, new work paradigms, organisational
            culture, virtual organisations, telework, and quality management.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Organisational ergonomics is trying to organise people and the work to best effect. Staying with Air Traffic Control;
            the ergonomist might be trying to create a process that matches controllers to shifts; the aim here might be to ensure
            you don't have the situation where all the controllers on the daytime shift at the peak of the holiday season have
            just left training school, and there's nobody around with real experience of the problems. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            This process that the ergonomist has designed would be used both by Human Resource people and by managers, to help
            make sure that this scenario doesn't happen. Another example;  in a steel rolling mill, the management has decided
            that they need to reduce the staff on each shift by 2 people.  Can this be done safely, for all the likely operational
            scenarios in the mill (including the disaster scenarios)?  How should the teams of operators be organised?
            In the new jobs that come out of this, what training will be necessary for each of the team members?
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4> | Project Work </h4>
          <p>
            Ergonomists can become specialists in certain areas, but many maintain a broad perspective to carry out wide-ranging
            projects. Here's a list of the kinds of things ergonomists worry about in any given project (automobile design, safety
            of underground systems, design of work, etc.).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As you will see, in the brackets are whole disciplines that people specialise in (For sure, you won't be bored,
            if you decide to become an Ergonomist!):
